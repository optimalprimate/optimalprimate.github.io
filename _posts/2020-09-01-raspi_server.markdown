# Raspberry Pi 4 Home Server Enclosure
## I decided to build a dedicated enclosure for the raspi running my home server.
I started with a bare board and graduated to a cheap enclosure with an inbuilt fan from eBay. This worked fine, but once I added an external hard drive for networked attached storage (NAS), I decided to make something a little more robust.
